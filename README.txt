YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search allows your users to search products in real time.

== Description ==

= Improve the user experience, improve your sales =

YITH WooCommerce Ajax Search is a really easy-to-use plugin. You just need to install it and it's ready to work.
It creates a simple search box in which, when you start to type your keyword, the plugin will suggest you the products that matching your searching criteria.
It is very useful to provide assistance to your users while they are trying to search any products in your website.

Did you ever forget the name of a product? Just start to write your keyphrase. A list with useful suggestion will be shown to you, and the more you write, the more accurate it will be. At that point, you'll only need to choose what you need.

It works just like Google Suggest, but on your website, using your database.

**Plugin's features:**

* Widget and shortcodes to show the searchform in every part of the site
* Options for the customization of the searchform
* Options for the visualization of the search results
